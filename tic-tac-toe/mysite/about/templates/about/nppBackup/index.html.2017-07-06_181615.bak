<em>Hello There:), here's my brief intro!<br/><br/>

My name is Jithin Paul and I am a graduate Student in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas. I completed my bachelors degree
in Computer Science from National institute of Technology- Calicut. In my final year at college, I was able to secure a job at Oracle Corporation 
where I spent my next four years. I worked as an Applications Engineer within the HCM and Payroll module of the PeopleSoft Enterprise-an
ERP software owned by Oracle.<br/><br/>

I moved to the United States in the Fall of 2016 to pursue my Masters degree and I will graduate in December 2017.:)
<br/><br/>
The bachelor's degree and current master’s degree in CS have really helped build a strong base in the Computer Science fundamentals. My stint at 
Oracle gave me a comprehensive exposure to the design and development cycles of a commercial software. I can confidently say that I am self-managed but a 
committed team player with good problem solving and communication skills.</em>

●	Tic Tac Toe game was written in Python and it uses the recursive minimax algorithm. Web application was created using the Django framework.

Tic Tac Toe game can be framed into a typical search problem involving trees. The levels in the tree can be thought of as the number of total moves
made by either players until that point and each node at a level represents a state of the tictactoe game-board. The levels are alternated
between the two players and from each state, a player can make a move and proceed to the next state at the next level.<br/><br/>

Let me make it more clear.<br/>

Imagine playing the tictactoe game on a game-board with your friend. Either, you can make the first move or your friend can do it.
But if you make the first move (lets call it move0), your friend will definitely make the next move(move1). Hence, you and your friend are going
to alternatively make these moves until one of you wins or the game ends in a draw. These moves (move0, move1,move2....) can be correlated to the
the levels of the tree. So at level0 move0 is made, at level1 move1 is made and so on.<br/>

The beginning of the game is level 0 with the root node representing the initial state of the game. You, being player1, makes the first move (move0) and
the game proceeds to one of the many different states represented by the root's children.

●	In-memory file system was written in Visual C++. It allows all the basic operations like creating, deleting and moving of files and 
directories, reading and writing of files etc. Users can also specify the memory size limit for the system in order to prevent the dynamic growth 
It also provides an option to write the data from the file system to disk at periodic intervals.
